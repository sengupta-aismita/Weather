# React + Vite
This Weather App is a React-based application that allows users to search for the current weather of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays key weather details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions in a visually appealing card format using Material UI components.

✨ Features:
✅ Search for real-time weather by city name
✅ Displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions
✅ Handles errors for invalid city names
✅ Styled using Material UI
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
